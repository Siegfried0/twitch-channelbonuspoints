TWITCH-HACKS is an userscript to improve the user experience at twitch with some slightly programmed life hacks.

### Installation

> There is no guarantee for the functionality of the script. If parts do not work, please deactivate other scripts first and/or use the issue tracker here on github.
There is no support for errors that occur when using the script from the dev branch. The dev branch is always experimental and may contain code that makes twitch unusable. 

The project was developed and tested with [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

If you have Tampermonkey (or similar) installed, you can simply install the user script by opening the [raw source code](https://github.com/Siegfried0/twitch-hacks/raw/master/twitch-hacks.user.js) in the browser and then following the installation process of the add-on you are using.
The script is built to let Tampermonkey know if a new version becomes available here in the repository (master branch) and can then automatically update.
